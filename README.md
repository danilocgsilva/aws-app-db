# Amazon AWS deploy ec2 and database

Amazon AWS allows fast deploying for virtual machines and databases. But deploying both, in a connected way isn't fast or easy.

This application allows you to:

* Deploy an ec2 virtual machine for the application
* Deploy an ec2 virtual machine uniquelly for database or lift an RDS instance
* Binds the application to the database
* Manages ec2 created for several applications
* Chooses if want to make it as Elasticbeanstalk service, lone virtual machine or Docker.
